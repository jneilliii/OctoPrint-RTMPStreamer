# OctoPrint-RTMPStreamer
**Overview:** Plugin that adds a tab to OctoPrint for viewing, starting, and stopping a re-encoded stream to any RTMP server.

**Warning:** Recent updates to Twitch's embed protocol has made the viewer enabled on the tab unusable. I'm looking into a solution but initial research indicates this may only be possible with a fully qualified domain name.

**Details:** Based on the work found [here](https://blog.alexellis.io/live-stream-with-docker/).

**Notes:** 
- Plugin requires that OctoPrint's webcam stream uses a full url path including the ip address, ie `http://192.168.1.2/webcam/?action=stream`
- Only tested streaming to Twitch from a Pi3.
- Plugin does not provide a streaming application, it just re-encodes the mjpg stream (included with ocotpi) to a flv stream and transmits to configured RTMP server url.
- Although resolution is configurable in the plugin, the mjpg input stream being re-encoded may have a lower resolution and therefore not really be as high as you set it in the plugin settings.

## Prerequisites for Streaming
Follow the instructions found [here](docker_instructions.md) to install and configure docker/ffmpeg for use with this plugin for Live streaming. This is not necessary if you just want to view a url in an iframe on a tab or if your octoprint system has ffmpeg.

## Setup
Once the prerequisites are met and the test command is successfull enter the resolution, stream url, and view url in the RTMP Streamer settings.

Don't forget to change your webcam stream url to a fully qualified url using the ip address of your pi like

http://192.168.1.101/webcam/?action=stream instead of /webcam/?action=stream

## TODO:
* [X] Additional testing.
* [X] Proper error messaging for debugging (e.g. no fully qualified url provided)
* [X] Add Dynamic Overlay settings
* [X] Add Dynamic Overlay build function
* [ ] Add Dynamic Overlay profiles, with some pre builts as examples
